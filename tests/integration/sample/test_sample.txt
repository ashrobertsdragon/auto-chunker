When Esgeril sat down at the table for lunch, she had a look in her eye that told me she wanted to revisit the conversation after I'd been putting off for months.
In the six months since she'd dropped her bombshell on me, we had mostly avoided the topic. First, I'd told her no, and then I'd told her I needed more time to process things. And then I just started avoiding the topic and coming up with reasons to leave. Telling your best friend that you love them isn't something you just drop on someone.
What was I supposed to tell her in return? Until a year ago, I had been engaged to a boy I'd been set up with since we were toddlers. I'd never had to even consider my sexuality. Esgeril had to understand that.
Besides, my track record with dating wasn't great. My first boyfriend dumped me when I became a Dragoneer, and my second sold me to pay off his gambling debts. Not that Lewon had been a real boyfriend.
"Are you going to eat that?" Esgeril asked, her lips in a lopsided grin.
I'd gotten lost in my head; my fork speared with a slice of beef hung inches from my open mouth.
I put the fork down and pushed the plate toward her. It was hard to eat when every time I saw her, my guts twisted inside. "Go ahead. I'm full."
The large bell outside tolled, cutting off any further conversation. Dragoneers around the cafeteria abandoned their half-eaten meals as they rushed for the door. Another round of Capture the Flag was about to start.
My stomach rumbled as I trotted to the field where Farean preened among the other Blues. I'd lied about not being hungry; I'd barely started my meal. Colonel Authand was like that, though. He'd call a game during meals, classes, even at night once. He wanted us to be prepared for battle no matter when.
At least Capture the Flag teams were sorted by dragon color. I wouldn't need to deal with Esgeril over with the other Reds.
I'd progressed quite a bit since my embarrassing start at the game last year. My first game happened less than an hour after I arrived, with no harness. I'd been grounded and forced to watch as a spectator until Lewon had tricked me into believing I could win the game. Instead, I had cost our team the win.
The third-year's had long memories, though. The new captain, Pene, refused to take advantage of Farean's superior flying abilities compared to the other Blues. Or Greens. Farean could do nearly anything that any color dragon could, but Pene didn't seem to care about that. Didn't seem to care about me. Jealousy of our skills should have disqualified him as our team captain, but I got outvoted.
By a lot.
Nobody voted for me for captain. Nobody would admit that I was clearly being punished for that long-ago mistake. I was still the princess that nobody wanted.
To punish me for daring to run against him, he put me with the first-years guarding the flag. His brilliant strategy was to put the three-year-old dragons, those who were reaching adulthood, as offense. The yearlings took defense, and the two-year-olds wandered about looking for opportunities.
Farean and I excelled at defense, of course. We'd hardly be the heroes of the Battle of Tulta if we weren't excellent defenders. But we could be so much more. And I would show them. Once Pene and the other third-years were out of my way, I'd win this game single-handedly.
<With my help, of course,> Farean said.
"Oh, yes. I always count you as part of me, my heart," I reassured her. And it was true. A year ago, I would have never imagined a bond as absolute as the one between Farean and me. Our hearts were one, almost literally. Saving her life after the battle had almost killed me.
The whistle blew to signal the start of the game. I dutifully carried our flag to the hiding spot Pene had decreed. He only had three spots that he ever used, and it had been found in each spot multiple times. We might as well have left it in the middle of the field.
"You five," I pointed at random. "Form a perimeter around the flag. I want groups of five at each of the other two spots we hide the flag, as decoys."
"That's not what Pene ordered," one complained.
"There's sixteen of us," said another.
"His orders are stupid," I snapped. "Aren't you tired of losing?"
We were in second place, only a game behind Green, but it grated me that, with Lewon as their captain, they were beating us. Florian certainly held it over me whenever she got a chance, and she wasn't even a Green. She was a Red, like Esgeril
Federa's nose crinkled. With anyone else, I would have taken it as disgust, but I'd noticed that Dragoneers with extra abilities were more common than Colonel Authand and the others let on. She could smell other dragons in the air. I'd once asked her if the Greens smelled worse, or just their riders. That had elicited a chuckle from her and an admission that it didn't work that way. It would be a good skill in a teammate, but her flying was still not the best. Besides, Esgeril had already agreed.
"Scatter," I shouted even though I held my ground. Federa's dragon passed the direction of an intruder on to Farean. Just before Florian and her Red dragon, Cadi, burst through the trees, we leaped into the air, blocking their view of the flag. They took the bait and gave chase, although they were no match for us in a sprint. After a minute, they gave up and broke off, heading for their base.
We landed with the others as they returned to our flag's hiding spot. "Red is going to know we are here within minutes. We still have time to move the flag. Take it to spot number three while we still have a chance."
A completely new hiding spot would have been better, but a lot of thought needed to go to flag placement. There were rules involved. You couldn't just stuff it in a tree. Hiding a flag in Capture the Flag was about strategy. And the flag had to be in its final position within ten minutes of the start of the game. Getting caught moving the flag after that would count as a disqualification.
There were mutters, but I shouted, "Now!" in the tone I'd been trained since birth to give orders with. It didn't help my reputation as being a spoiled princess, but there was little time.
That sent them moving. "Which group are you going with?" asked the Dragoneer who had pointed out our numbers before. "With the flag?"
I grinned. "I'm going to a flag. Just not ours."
Most dragons flew the game in short bursts in the sky before dropping into the trees again to avoid detection. The Greens' maneuverability and ability to fly below the tree canopy was their advantage.
As it was ours. For some reason, Farean's abilities overlapped with the other colors. We weren't as maneuverable as the Greens, steady as the Reds, or big as the Oranges, but we were more of those things than any other Blue we'd encountered. Just one more thing that made her special in ways I was too scared to question.
Which is why I knew it was intentional when a branch struck my arm. "Ow!"
I rubbed my arm as I pushed some healing energy into the bruise, just enough to keep others from knowing it had happened. My ability hadn't been as strong since healing Farean from the brink of death, and it took more out of me than before. Yet, after the game, I'd be expected to heal everyone's injuries. I only did major ones, like broken bones, and acted like cuts and bruises, like the one on my arm, were beneath me.
The truth of the matter was that, without taking a heavy dose of stimleaf, even just healing those major injuries would put me in a healer's berth next to my patients.
<That wouldn't have happened if you were paying attention,> Farean said, her tone smug. <The threat you don't notice�">
"�"is the one that kills you," I finished. "Yeah, I know. But you were paying attention. You did that on purpose."
Farean ignored the accusation. <I don't like the way you've been. We won't win the Dragon Run like this. With this amount of insubordination, we might not even get to compete. Plus, it's hard to make friends with the other dragons when none of their riders can stand you. Your feelings for Esgeril are getting in the way.>
I sighed. "I don't have feelings for her; we're just friends."
<You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me,> Farean grumbled. <I know what your heart says.>
"I don't even know what it says," I snapped. "And even if I did, it doesn't matter, so there's no need to have this conversation again. We have a game to win," Farean grumbled once more, but she kept her thoughts to herself. She knew I was done with this conversation.
We flew above the trees, heading perpendicular to our goal. As we flew, we rose until the air grew cold and winds buffeted us. We couldn't last long at this altitude, but we didn't have to. In the blue, cloudless sky, a Blue dragon was almost impossible to notice.
The same couldn't be said of a bunch of Orange dragons. The Orange team had a few scouts around, trying to score points, but most of the team concentrated on defense.
Few people ever dared to attack the Orange flag, because you would have to avoid a sea of big dragons.
We circled until we spotted the flag, barely a spec from this height. Farean tucked in her wings as we dove. We gained speed as we fell, faster and faster. The ground rushed toward us, and all I could hear was wind.
They spotted us just a hundred feet above their heads.
When you are big, you are slow. And we were moving fast. Very, very fast. I saw an Orange dragon roar in alarm, but I couldn't hear it over the sound of the wind rushing past my ears. Before they could even move, we'd dropped the final distance. Farean rolled at the last second, and I grabbed the flag. As soon as the fabric was in my fingers, she rolled again and snapped her wings open.
My teeth snapped shut at the sudden jolt. Farean pumped her wings as the Orange dragons converged on the spot, we'd resided just a breath earlier. Several gave chase, but we were out of Orange territory before they were more than a few feet off the ground.
Farean banked toward the common area, where the flags were brought to be awarded points.
"No," I told her. "We are getting them all."
<Even the Green?>
Nobody had found the Green flag all season. Holding on to one flag while searching for another was risky enough. Holding on to two while searching for the third was foolhardy at best. But I was tired of being underestimated. I was the hero of the Battle of Tulta, but we were never allowed to explore our full potential. I didn't know what the limits of Farean's and my abilities were, but they certainly extended further than sitting on the ground protecting a flag. I yearned for offense.
Thinking of her brought a pang, but I pushed it aside. An unwritten rule of Capture the Flag was that you left relationships and friendships at the gong.
My surprise attack on their flag had roused the Orange team. Most chased after us, a fool's task if there ever was one, but several fanned out into the Red, Blue, and Green territories. Orange was going on the offense for the first time since I had arrived at Tulta.
I hoped that the three first-years I left guarding our flag were up for the task. A nearly full-grown Orange was an intimidating sight for a dragon only a month old.
I followed the contingent of Oranges heading into the Red territory. We flew just a few feet above the canopy but behind them. Unused to doing more than guarding their own flag, they weren't checking their rear.
<The threat you don't notice...> Farean clucked.
"Fortunately for them, I'm not interested in taking them out," I responded. One of the things that Flatch, who taught history, but always laced strategy through it, had taught us: let your enemy do your work for you. He meant it in the sense that you wait for the enemy to come to you, but it seemed to work for this, too.
Orange dragons found and tagged Red dragons with ruthless efficiency. For the game, each team was outfitted with mock weapons, similar to what we would have in battle but designed not to injure. A wooden sword coated in blue chalk hung by my side. Three hits, and a dragon was considered disabled.
A fallen Red spotted me, but kept his mouth shut. On the battlefield, the dead couldn't warn their comrades, and neither could fallen dragons or riders in Capture the Flag.
As long as Orange continued to commit to blind offense, they would lead us right to the Red flag.
The Orange contingent banked hard to the right and picked up speed, as much as three-ton dragons could. Their formation remained perfect, even in the game. Roars from the Red dragons erupted when they spotted the Oranges. I counted half a dozen, met by a dozen in return. If this was a battle, it would have been a bloodbath. We dropped well below the canopy. If Farean extended her legs, they would drag on the ground.
Following the sound of the battle above, we found the Red flag in a lone tree in the middle of a large-ish clearing. Their dragons flew around it, slightly above and slightly below, flying in opposite circles.
The Red defenders bore bows with blunt-tipped arrows, coated in red chalk. The Orange dragons descended on them in waves. The archers took out a couple but more took their place. We used the distraction to swoop up at the base of the pole, inside of the dragon perimeter. The flag came free in my hands, and we continued to shoot up before the Red team realized what had happened.
Bows swiveled to us, but one Orange dragon continued its attack, taking out two of the archers before they could shoot.
The others, both the Reds and the Oranges, followed after us. We dipped below the trees and took a hard turn before heading toward the Green territory. It wouldn't shake our pursuers completely, but it would slow them considerably.
Two flags down, one to go.
We lost our pursuers inside the Green territory and stopped at a stream for water. This wasn't the hardest Farean had pushed herself, but she wasn't holding back, either.
I slid off her back to refill my canteen. Always fill it when you have a chance, even if you'd only taken a sip. That was another lesson Esgeril had taught me.
"Still running off on your own, I see," Lewon said behind me.
I managed not to jump; that would be exactly what he wanted. Instead, I internally berated myself for not making sure everything was clear.
"Still underestimating me, I see," I retorted as I finished filling the canteen. The lid secure, I slid it into its spot in my harness. He didn't have his sword out, at least not yet. If I reached for mine, he was the quicker draw. Plus, he was a better duelist by far. I'd have to outwit him. At least on that battlefield, he was outmatched.
Lewon didn't respond to my taunt. "Did you think you could hide from the Orange and Red teams out here? I'm just debating whether to tag you myself or to lead them here to you. That might be entertaining to watch."
While he bragged, I took a small step toward him. To someone not paying close attention, the motion would have looked like I was shifting my weight. It's something he should have spotted, but as usual, he was overconfident. "I've been debating whether to force you to admit what you did to me or to just bring Roland to collect you." Another step.
His nostrils flared and his hand went to his sword. "Go ahead. He's after you, too."
<I see the flag,> Farean said. <It's in the tree behind Calen.>
My eyes flicked in the direction of the Green dragon perched on a thick branch. The entire pole had been mounted in a hollowed-out portion of the trunk, leaving the flag partially hidden in the leaves.
"Interesting spot for the flag," I told him. "I'm not sure it's one hundred percent in line with Colonel Authand's rules. Maybe we should call him here to check. Or you can just give it to me, and we can keep it between ourselves." Another step.
"Ha." He laughed. "It would be on the ground before he got here. Your word against mine. He trusts me. You're just a spoiled little royal."
Another step. I now stood just a few feet from him, and he hadn't even noticed. Farean leaped at Calen. She twisted out of his reach just before reaching the Green dragon.
Lewon turned his head to watch, as Farean feinted again. "Are you going to try to scare him out of that tree? Is that your master plan?"
"Or maybe she'll just attack," I responded. "Look." I pointed. Farean flew at Calen again, claws out. It was a dirty move for the game, and technically illegal, but it got the job done of turning Lewon's entire focus off of me.
I drew my blade. Not the wooden sword on my left but the knife at my right. I don't know why I did it. Maybe I just wanted him to suffer for a change. Charging, I knocked him down just as Farean turned her claws back in. Calen's attention shifted for a second to us, and Farean took advantage of broadsiding him with enough force that the branch cracked.
I pressed the point of my knife against his neck, which put a quick stop to his fighting against me. If I had used the mock weapon, they would have been out of the game, but I didn't expect Lewon to acknowledge that.
I pushed until I drew blood. With my other hand, I pushed healing energy into the wound with the blade still piercing his skin. He howled in pain; it had to be excruciating. After what he did to me last year, tricking me like that, trying to sell me to a nightblood, and then lying to everyone about it, lying again after I saved his life, I wanted to hurt him. It took all my restraint to not push the blade all the way into his neck.
Calen flew at us, but Farean knocked him down. "The flag," I told her.
She hesitated, but I glared at her, and she let Calen up.
The Green went for us again, but I bared my teeth at him. "Come closer, and I kill him." I pressed the knife deeper, to prove my point.
Calen hesitated. Farean grabbed the flag and landed beside me. I let up on the healing energy to grab the wooden sword. It was awkward with my off hand, but I smacked it hard against his chest. Proof that he had been bested by a Blue rider.
I sheathed the knife and healed the wound. "You can try telling the colonel, but it will be your word against mine. And then you would have to admit that the spoiled little royal beat you." I climbed up Farean and clicked my harness into place.
Lewon glared as I flew off.
"Let's go win this game."
***
We didn't bother for stealth. Farean flew straight at the parade field in the open air with a trail of Green, Red, and Orange dragons collecting behind us. An Orange came at us from the north, but we dodged her easily.
From the south came a Red, Baran, with an Esgeril aiming one of her red chalked bolts at us. They flew at us at top speed.
"Baran says that Esgeril is really upset," Farean passed on to me.
She had to be humiliated at the way we had slipped by her at the Red flag. That was the only part of this gambit I regretted. Her team probably thought she had allowed us by. Despite saving the entire camp a few months ago, most Dragoneers still had a low opinion of me. Well, that would change today.
I let her get close, closer than I'd let anyone else get to us. Baran, for his part, didn't flinch at our collision course. At the last moment, we dipped below them. The other dragons would see it as yielding, which should let them save some face.
<And cost me mine,> Farean grumbled.
I patted her neck. "Dragons will tell of what you did here today for years to come. We can share some of the glory with them."
Looking back at Esgeril and Baran as they turned to join the pack chasing us, I nearly missed a Green dragon rising up from the trees just ahead of us. We swerved, but they swerved with us.
We went up, but they followed. The Green dragon matched us move for move as they got closer.
If we were tagged out now, we'd never get another chance at this. Not today, and probably not ever.
We couldn't outmaneuver them, but I could probably outsmart them.
Understanding my plan, Farean gave up any pretense of trying to avoid the Green.
The rider's eyes had the same steely determination as mine. We both urged our dragons on faster and faster.
With just dozens of feet to go, Farean braked her wings. My stomach lurched as we dropped.
The Green matched our trajectory, but we were moving faster. I drew my wooden sword and ducked as we slipped under them. The sword smashed into the soft part her belly with enough force to pull it out of my hands. The Green shrieked in pain, which I echoed.
The dragon, obviously hurting, slowed to land in a nearby clearing. Her rider, a transgender girl named Alu, shouted something, probably curses, that was lost on the wind.
My right arm hung limp at my side. I'd dislocated it enough times to know what to do. I tore off an extra-large piece of stimleaf �" I was starting to get low and would have to figure out a way of getting more �" and shoved it into my mouth. Letting my harness hold me, I waited for the initial burst of energy to pass as I chewed.
Pushing as much healing energy into my left hand as possible, I bent my right arm back and shoved it as hard as I could into the socket.
Pain flared and then subsided. I tried the arm again. It moved but was still a bit sore. I'd have to heal the rest of it the old-fashioned way.
Farean slowed. Healing used her energy as well and we'd been flying at top speed for most of the last hour, with only the fight with Lewon and Calen as a break. We weren't pulling ahead of the others anymore, but at least they weren't gaining on us, either. As long as we could keep this pace for another half-mile, we would be okay.
The sky was empty of other Blue dragons. I hoped that meant they were all guarding the flag pole. Once we reached the field, we still had to run the flags up.
I'd never have a chance to run them individually, so I used the last minutes to tie the three flags together. Then I would only have to hook one carabiner and raise them at once.
We passed into the parade filed. My teammates were there, but they all hung back well away from the pole, beaten to the defensive positions by the other teams. Instead, at the base, three Orange dragons paced. For good measure, six three-year-old Red dragons flew around the top, lest we repeat our stunt from their pole.
<It was a good effort. I can't believe we almost did it. Where should we set down?> Farean asked, resignation mixed with relief tinged her words.
I undid the buckles connecting my harness to hers. "Go right over them all. We are going to give them a show before we give up."
<Kalia, what are you doing? Are you trying to get yourself killed?>"
"No, it will be fine." With the flags bunched up in my hands, I pushed myself up onto my feet, balancing on Farean's back, first in a crouch and then standing upright. I let the flags billow out behind me as we flew. Farean slowed to focus more on providing me with a platform for my reckless stunt.
Authand stood in the judges' box in the middle of the field. He used a horn to make himself heard at the distance. "Kalia, you get down right this instant." Korth's tail twitched in the anger that the colonel must have felt. Floor boards bounced where his tail hit them.
My commanding officer gave me a direct order, so I complied.
I leaped from Farean's back into the sky. Farean tried to catch me, but I dropped like a stone until I was well out of her reach.
I used the flags as a parachute, but I was falling much too fast. Contrary to what I'd told Farean, this had a lot of possibility of turning out not fine. Being honest, it had very little chance of ending well.
The Red dragons switched from game mode to rescue mode. While the others fanned out to give space, one pulled into tight circles in an attempt to catch me.
Farean hesitated. If another dragon rescued me from my own stupidity, she would be humiliated by the idea that she couldn't keep my safe. If it didn't, I could die. After a moment, she trusted my judgment and dove at the Red.
The other dragon dodged the attack, leaving me with a gap to fall through.
I missed the clip at the top of the pole but flipped the flags up. The last one, the Green, caught on the dragon finial.
The fabric ripped as I fell past the slack, and I slowed as the fabric tore. The tear moved down until it reached the knot. If that gave, I would be in trouble. I was still more than fifty feet above the ground.
But the knot held, and I nearly lost my grip when I stopped hard.
"One hundred fifty points to Blue," Authand, emotionless, boomed through his speaking horn. His face betrayed no emotion, at least from what I could see at this distance. "Blue team wins. Game over."
One of the Reds approached to fetch me, but I pulled my knife and slashed the rope. It came free, and I rode it down, wrapping the ruined flag around the pole. It didn't work as well as I'd hoped, and I hit the ground harder than expected. I dropped my shoulder, the one that had been injured just a few minutes ago and rolled. I bit back a scream as it slammed into a rock, but I used the momentum to launch myself onto my feet.
Farean touched down next to me as the Orange I had landed near scurried out of her way.
Others began to fall in around us, taking their color's positions around the field.
The faces around me conveyed a mixture of emotions: shock, anger, frustration, and disgust. Nobody looked happy, not even my Blue teammates. And especially not Pene.
As soon as he was free if his dragon, he stormed over to me and the flags waving in tatters in the breeze.
"I knew you were worthless," he shouted, pushing his finger at my chest.
I slapped it away. He was cute, and half the girls in camp had a crush on him, but that didn't give him permission to have his hand that close to my breasts. Farean snarled and bared her teeth at him. His dragon roared back, but Pene had the good sense to back away from me.
"What do you mean worthless? I just won the game."
"It wasn't yours to win. I gave you an order as team captain, and I expected you to follow it." He balled his fists but didn't make a move.
"Then maybe you should give orders that are worth following!"
The rest of the camp stood motionless, staring at us. Farean was still riding high on adrenaline and was equally angry at him and me.
An angry dragon was like a lump of firerock, just needing the least jostle to explode. I knew I had to defuse the situation, but I also didn't want to.
The decision was made for me when Tulowa, the healer, approached. "Shame on you, the lot of you. You have your dragons to attend to, instead of standing there egging these two on to battle."
I didn't think anyone was egging us on, but I probably would have done something I'd regret if he hadn't stepped in.
Tulowa glanced around for Esgeril. He still feared her, after she'd pulled a knife on him last year when he'd tried to stop me from healing Farean after the Battle of Tulta.
She wasn't particularly close, but she and Baran had moved toward the front of the Reds when things had become tense. It struck me that I didn't know whether she would fight with or against me, didn't know how angry she was about the Red flag or about the stunt I had just pulled. The crowd was breaking up, though, and she seemed inclined to leave with them, leading Baran to the lake for a good scrub.
Satisfied she was in no position to attack, Tulowa came closer. "Come now, we have work to do. Our patients await." Without waiting to see if we followed, he turned on his heel with military precision and strode back to the camp's medical clinic, where he spent most of his time.
I didn't dare try to climb back on Farean with my shoulder. Instead, I walked beside her until we reached the building.
I patted Farean's muzzle before we parted ways. Using my left hand made it awkward, but it hurt to move my other arm. I stuffed some more stimleaf into my mouth before entering. I'd used way too much today, and now I had a headache.
The healer's building was bright as usual, too bright for me, but there wasn't much I could do about it. Somebody would say something if I started snuffing out the oil lamps that lined the hallway walls. The astringent odor hit me in the face when I entered, which didn't help matters. Fortunately, the large window in the room in which I healed would let in fresh air to diminish the smell. And the lamps weren't lit in here, either.
I surveyed the line as I walked to the door. Three Orange riders and a Blue. That was fewer than usual, but this game had been shorter, too, thanks to me.
"How many dragons are outside?" I asked Farean. While I healed elves inside, she would heal the dragons outside, taking turns so it didn't strain us too much.
<Eight Oranges. And Cadi. She's got a pretty big tear in her right wing.>
"Is she in a lot of pain?" I asked. "Maybe we should start with her." As much as I hated Florian, her dragon shouldn't suffer for something, as Baran would say, "beneath the affairs of dragons."
<She'll live.> Farean shook her head in our mental dialogue. <Trust me, Cadi is no peach, either. I'm more worried about Beli. His talon split clear to the flesh. It could get infected.>
My tutors back home hadn't been a fan of the recent idea that something we couldn't see could make us sick, but Tulowa had been passing his knowledge on to me in extra classes that the colonel made me attend. I had no interest in becoming a professional healer, and I think Authand realized that I'd never not join the action, but it did make sense for someone with the ability to magically heal others to know what they were healing.
Farean's tail rested on a table in the workroom, making it the perfect height to rest my hand on while we healed. She transmitted everything she did through our connection, and it was almost as if I was picking up the Orange's talon in my own claw. The split was indeed nasty.
"We need to check to make sure nothing is broken before we do anything," I told her. A tendril of my healing magic traced the talon up beneath the dragon's scales to the bone. As I suspected, the bone had splintered where it connected.
"Stupid dragon should have told us that, instead of worrying about his talon," I mumbled. Without me, that talon would have fallen off and a new one would have grown in its place. It would have hurt a lot, and, as Farean had pointed out, there was a chance of infection. But this fracture, not properly treated, could result in losing the entire toe.
By the time we finished treating Beli, I had to sit down. I pinched off a small piece of stimleaf and waited for it to take effect. I'd just started on the next patient when Tulowa entered. While I took care of the bigger injuries, he patched up the cuts and scratches. He was a big fan of this gel that smelled of alcohol. It burned like fire when applied to open wounds, but it got the job done. I could smell it on him when he entered.
I explained what the first injury had been and how I treated it. He nodded his approval as he entered it into his log. "Good thinking, checking for a fracture. I will have a word with Beli's rider about being more diligent when checking for injuries. Alright, time for your next patient."
Having finished with his patients, he sat on a stool in the corner, occasionally lending an extra hand or a word of advice while I healed the remaining elves and dragons. With enough energy, I could heal just about anything, but it was a lot easier if I knew just how to direct the golden light.
The last patient gone, I collapsed onto the cot that the elves laid on while getting treated. I wiped the sweat of my brow, but that didn't do much good when I was covered head to toe in perspiration.
"It appears that you have overexerted yourself, my dear." Tulowa opened a cupboard by the door and retrieved a jar filled with stimleaf.
My eyes widened. All this time, there had been a stash just a few feet from where I worked. The knowledge would come in handy in the future. I doubted that General Lutania had meant to give me as much as she had when we had flown hundreds of leagues to Verlo for reinforcements for the Battle of Tulta.
I still needed to find a regular supply, but this would help while healing.
"Have you used this before?" he asked.
I nodded. If he knew just how much I'd been using, he would never give me the sliver held between his fingers.
I savored the stimleaf, letting it dissolve on my tongue. Feeling better, I said my goodbyes and left the clinic.
The sun was low when I got outside. Farean trundled down to the lake for a bath and scrub in the warm sand. I should wash her, but neither of us were up for it. I probably had an hour until the dinner bell. I could still make most of History of the Dragoneers, Years 583�"715 Since the First goblin War, but I was in no state to attempt that class, either.
"What were you thinking, pulling that stunt?" Esgeril's voice behind me startled me so I nearly jumped out of my own skin.
"The threat you don't notice..." I giggled. I'd definitely had too much stimleaf. I felt giddy, and not wholly in control of my reasoning abilities. That's the only way I can explain what happened next.
I kissed her.

"I shouldn't have done that; I'm sorry." I blushed to my ear tips.
Esgeril looked at me, part smile, part consternation. "If we were dating, you wouldn't have to apologize."
I sighed. I had to do it. I'd been putting this off for too long, afraid it would jeopardize our friendship. But leaving her hanging like this was doing just that. I didn't know what telling her would do, but not telling her would destroy us.
"Let's go for a walk. I don't want to do this in public." Most of the other Dragoneers were in classes or attending to other duties, but there were a few in the square. Without consciously choosing a direction, I led us toward the woods. I still felt most at home around nature.
The truth was, I still didn't know how to do this. I came up and rejected several ideas as we left the camp behind us.  The knot in my stomach grew with each attempt. If Farean had left the issue alone, I wouldn't be stuck out her
Finally, she spoke up. "You had something you wanted to say to me?"
"About that. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to say this. I had to figure out how I felt."
She looked up at me, her smile widening. No, no, no. I was giving her the wrong impression.
"It's just that I'm not..." The words stalled on my lips.
Her smile faltered. "Not what? Not gay? Not attracted to me?" Each sentence came out a little louder. "Baran has caught you staring at my butt."
I blushed again, glancing around furiously to make sure nobody could have heard.
<I've seen you do it, too,> Farean added, from the lake
"You be quiet," I told her.
Esgeril stamped her foot, bringing my attention back to her. "Well, are you going to deny it?"
"I stare at boys' butts, too," I blurted. Oh, for Farr's sake, Kalia. Why did you say that? "It's just... No. The answer is no. I'm sorry, but I don't want to date you. I'm still a princess and have things expected of me. I don't know if Etlin will have me back, or I'll be married to some other noble. I'm sure my parents are working on that. We have no future, romantically. It's not fair to either of us to try to start something that will have to end."
She stood there in silence. I chewed my lip, a habit my tutors had never broken me from. "I still want to be your friend."
"I want that, too." Her lip quivered. A sigh, and then her shoulders slumped before a mask slid over her face, set like stone. "But right now, I want to be alone." She turned on her heel, leaving me alone.
I didn't move for a long time. Once I knew Esgeril wasn't near enough to see or hear, I screamed in frustration. She hated me. I'd messed it all up. And why? Because of a throne that, if I was being honest with myself, I didn't even want. It wasn't even my throne. I'd just be a figurehead. It hadn't bothered me before, but I hadn't known of anything different until last year.
If Mother and Father had had another child, I wouldn't be in this predicament. If I hadn't been at the hatching, none of this would have ever happened. My life would be better.
<You don't mean that,> Farean cried. For the first time, I cursed our stronger than normal connection. <Please tell me you don't mean that.>
I screamed again, and kicked at the dirt, at some old goblin tracks left over from the battle.
"That's not what I meant. I don't regret you. It's just, everything else." I waved my arm in the general direction of the camp. "Don't you ever wish that we could just go off by ourselves? Nobody falling in love. Nobody underestimating us. Maybe we should run away. Fight the goblins ourselves. We could probably win this war, the two of us, if people would just let us."
<If only,> she replied wistfully.
I plopped down next to an ash, daydreaming of a simpler world. The rough bark, warm from the sun, felt good against my back.
My back felt good. It had been full of knots earlier from leaning over my patients while healing. The shoulder I'd dislocated this afternoon was no longer sore, either. In fact, I felt great. All the bruises I'd just partially healed, all the injuries I'd accumulated since healing Farean after the Battle of Tulta, were gone. As were the buzz and impending crash from the stimleaf. I felt like a new elf.
<I feel better, too,> Farean said. <I'd thought it was from washing up, but it's more than that. What happened? We aren't even touching. We aren't even close.>
I wasn't religious, but I was leaning against an ash, a tree named after the goddess of the wood. The god Farr supposedly banished her to tree form when she created elves. I'm not sure why we worshiped a god that didn't even want us existing, but I'd never met an Ash worshiper. Instead, the story of our creation and her punishment were used as a cautionary tale against disobeying authority. The leaves rustled, even though there wasn't a breeze. In fact, the air was unnaturally still.
Could the stories be true? Was I leaning against a goddess? I sat upright. I didn't know what I believed, but I wouldn't disrespect a deity by using her as a chair.
The dinner bell rang, the single deep toll that announced our meal was ready. I cursed but stopped in the middle, looking at the ash. I mumbled an apology.
I wouldn't get in trouble if I missed dinner, but I would go hungry. I stood, stretched, and sprinted back in the direction of the camp. I don't know if it was my imagination, but I felt faster. Indeed, the other Dragoneers were still filing into the dining hall when I arrived. I was winded but not overly so.
I scanned the cafeteria. Esgeril was nowhere to be found. My heart stopped for a moment. That was my fault.
The Blue riders spread out over their tables to not leave any room for me. That was okay. I didn't want to sit with them, either. I took up a seat at a table near the trash cans, my usual spot when I didn't eat with Esgeril.
I didn't think I would eat much, with everything weighing on my mind, but I cleared my plate and even went up for seconds and a third helping. I could probably eat a fourth, but the dinner period was wrapping up.
Now that I no longer needed tutoring with Flatch, the free period after dinner was mine to do as I pleased. Most nights I spent it with Farean, but she was already dozing in her stall. Instead, I just went back to my room and laid down. Farean Curfew wasn't for hours yet, but my eyelids felt heavy. I barely got my clothes off before sleep took me.
